## Rewards

With each play session, a player is given a specified time (e.g., three minutes) to move around the map collecting items that match their color. Collecting non-matching items decreases their size and remaining time, while matching items reward extra time and possibly one of the following:
- NFT
- Token


### Blacklisting or Whitelisting
Players can be blacklisted or whitelisted by the admin based on defined criteria.
